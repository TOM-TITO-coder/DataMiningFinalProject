# Energy Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting energy prices using machine learning techniques. Energy price prediction is crucial for stakeholders in the energy sector, including policymakers, utility companies, and consumers, to make informed decisions. The project leverages data mining techniques to analyze historical energy consumption and pricing data.

## Goals
- Predict future energy prices based on historical data.
- Identify key factors influencing energy prices, such as demand, weather conditions, and market trends.
- Provide actionable insights to support energy market stability and decision-making.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Energy consumption and pricing data from publicly available sources (e.g., government databases, Kaggle datasets, or industry reports).
- **Features:** 
  - Date and time
  - Energy demand (kWh)
  - Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.)
  - Market factors (supply constraints, regulations)
  - Historical prices

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
   - Gather historical data on energy consumption and prices.
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and anomalies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze data patterns and trends.
   - Visualize relationships between variables to identify key influencing factors.

3. **Model Development**  
   - Use regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting.
   - Train and test models to predict energy prices based on historical data.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ².
   - Fine-tune the model for better accuracy.

5. **Visualization and Insights**  
   - Present findings using interactive dashboards or plots.
   - Highlight factors driving price fluctuations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**  
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation  
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization  
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning models  
- **Other Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Power BI/Tableau (optional)

## Deliverables
- A trained and validated model for energy price prediction.
- Visualizations of trends and patterns in the data.
- A report summarizing the findings and recommendations.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/energy-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate results:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Future Work
- Incorporate real-time data for dynamic price prediction.
- Expand the model to account for geopolitical and economic factors.
- Use deep learning models for improved accuracy.
